# Preact Migration Progress

## Scope So Far
- Converted message item renderer to JSX (`MessageItems.tsx`) and updated `renderMessageItems` to use `preact-render-to-string`.
- Dropped placeholder token substitution (Option A) in favor of native Preact escaping; adjusted tests accordingly.
- Kept public API (`renderMessageItems(messages)`) stable so server routes and other code did not need changes.

## Decisions & Rationale
- Started with the smallest fragment (`messages`) to minimize risk and validate toolchain (TSX, JSX settings in `tsconfig.json`).
- Removed manual HTML string concatenation for messages in favor of component clarity and future composability.
- Test adjustments: relaxed strict snapshot requiring `&gt;` for closing angle bracket to allow normal Preact output while still asserting safety (`&lt;script` and absence of raw `<script>` tag).
- Avoided `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` per project guidelines; relied on Preact's built-in escaping.

## Current State
- Fragment level: messages and IP list now JSX-based.
- Sessions list still raw template string in `renderSessionsUl` (manual escapeHtml).
- Page templates (`session-detail.ts`, `sessions-list.ts`) still raw template strings.
- Escaping strategy mixed: JSX fragments rely on Preact escaping; remaining raw templates use escapeHtml. IP list validated (digits + dots) so manual escaping removed.

## Suggested Next Targets (Incremental)
1. Migrate `renderSessionsUl` to JSX (`SessionsUl`) inside `lists.tsx`.
2. (DONE) Extract shared `Layout` component for repeated `<html><head>` boilerplate.
3. (DONE) Migrate session detail page to JSX using `Layout` + components.
4. Migrate `sessions-list.ts` using `SessionsUl` + `IpsUl`.
5. After page migrations, reassess inline styles for potential consolidation.

## Risks & Mitigations
- Snapshot drift: Mitigated by updating expectations only where necessary; future conversions should similarly keep assertion semantics (structure, required IDs, safety markers) rather than brittle full snapshots.
- Performance: `preact-render-to-string` overhead negligible for small fragments; monitor if large page conversions introduce noticeable latency (can micro-benchmark later).
- Escaping parity: Ensure any manual escaping removal is accompanied by test changes verifying absence of raw dangerous sequences rather than exact entity sequences.

## Testing Strategy Moving Forward
- For each migrated fragment: add/adjust a focused test verifying key structural markers and escaped dynamic content.
- Avoid over-snapshotting large pages; prefer targeted `toContain` checks for IDs, classes, and dynamic text safety.

## Open Questions
- Should page-level CSS remain inline or begin refactoring into a shared style block component? (Pros: dedupe; Cons: early abstraction.)
- Keep functions returning strings vs. expose components directly to callers? (Routes currently expect stringsâ€”keep until broader refactor.)
- Introduce a utility `renderComponent(<Comp ... />)` wrapper to unify rendering + potential future hooks (e.g., timing, logging)?

## Minimal Guiding Principles
- Migrate smallest units first (lists, sections) before full pages.
- Preserve function signatures to avoid wide ripple changes until confidence is high.
- Prefer readable JSX over dense template string concatenation; keep functions small.
- Update tests only as needed; favor semantic assertions over full HTML string snapshots.

## Next Action (Pending Approval)
- Convert `lists.ts` to JSX components and adapt tests. After that proceed to a page template.

## Progress Since Last Update (2025-10-25)
- Sessions & IP list fragments migrated to JSX (`lists.tsx`): `renderSessionsUl` and `renderIpsUl` now use Preact rendering and native escaping; manual `escapeHtml` removed for these lists.
- Introduced dedicated `SessionDetailPage` component (`src/components/SessionDetailPage.tsx`) and server page render helper (`rendering/session-detail.tsx`) producing full HTML via JSX.
- Both primary pages now JSX-based: session detail (`SessionDetailPage`) and sessions list (`SessionsListPage`) render via `Layout`.
- Inline styles centralized in `Layout` constant; no `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` usage.
- Delete / clear actions retained using Datastar `data-on` attributes; no manual EventSource usage introduced.

## Updated Remaining Targets
1. Consolidate any remaining duplicated style rules (review for extraction or minor tweaks).
2. Add/adjust focused tests for new page/component renderers (ensure structure + safety; already partially covered, verify sessions list JSX path).
3. Consider introducing a `renderComponent()` helper for timing/logging consistency.
4. Micro-benchmark render performance (optional) before further abstraction.
5. Evaluate need for additional escaping helpers or guards as data shapes evolve.

## Notes & Considerations
- Ensure continued validation upstream for `ip` and `sessionId` before rendering to keep reliance on Preact escaping safe.
- Maintain small component boundaries; avoid premature abstraction until both pages share enough markup (then potential shared specialized fragments beyond `Layout`).
- Keep existing string-returning export functions (`renderSessionDetailPage`, upcoming `renderSessionsListPage` JSX version) to avoid ripple changes in route handlers for now.
