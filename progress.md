# Preact Migration Progress

## Scope So Far
- Converted message item renderer to JSX (`MessageItems.tsx`) and updated `renderMessageItems` to use `preact-render-to-string`.
- Dropped placeholder token substitution (Option A) in favor of native Preact escaping; adjusted tests accordingly.
- Kept public API (`renderMessageItems(messages)`) stable so server routes and other code did not need changes.

## Decisions & Rationale
- Started with the smallest fragment (`messages`) to minimize risk and validate toolchain (TSX, JSX settings in `tsconfig.json`).
- Removed manual HTML string concatenation for messages in favor of component clarity and future composability.
- Test adjustments: relaxed strict snapshot requiring `&gt;` for closing angle bracket to allow normal Preact output while still asserting safety (`&lt;script` and absence of raw `<script>` tag).
- Avoided `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` per project guidelines; relied on Preact's built-in escaping.

## Current State
- Fragment level: messages now JSX-based.
- Page templates (`session-detail.ts`, `sessions-list.ts`) and list fragments (`lists.ts`) still raw template strings.
- Escaping strategy now mixed (manual escapeHtml in lists/pages, automatic in messages). Consistency will improve as we migrate more components.

## Suggested Next Targets (Incremental)
1. Convert `lists.ts` (sessions + IP lists) to `lists.tsx` with two small components: `SessionsListUl` and `IpsListUl`.
2. Extract a shared `PageShell` component to encapsulate `<html><head>...` repeated markup (preserving styles, meta, and inline CSS). Keep returning a string.
3. Migrate `session-detail.ts` to JSX using `PageShell` + `MessagesSection` (reusing `MessageItems`).
4. Migrate `sessions-list.ts` similarly, using `SessionsListUl`.
5. Centralize inline styles as constants or minimal styled components (optional; maintain current visual fidelity first).

## Risks & Mitigations
- Snapshot drift: Mitigated by updating expectations only where necessary; future conversions should similarly keep assertion semantics (structure, required IDs, safety markers) rather than brittle full snapshots.
- Performance: `preact-render-to-string` overhead negligible for small fragments; monitor if large page conversions introduce noticeable latency (can micro-benchmark later).
- Escaping parity: Ensure any manual escaping removal is accompanied by test changes verifying absence of raw dangerous sequences rather than exact entity sequences.

## Testing Strategy Moving Forward
- For each migrated fragment: add/adjust a focused test verifying key structural markers and escaped dynamic content.
- Avoid over-snapshotting large pages; prefer targeted `toContain` checks for IDs, classes, and dynamic text safety.

## Open Questions
- Should page-level CSS remain inline or begin refactoring into a shared style block component? (Pros: dedupe; Cons: early abstraction.)
- Keep functions returning strings vs. expose components directly to callers? (Routes currently expect stringsâ€”keep until broader refactor.)
- Introduce a utility `renderComponent(<Comp ... />)` wrapper to unify rendering + potential future hooks (e.g., timing, logging)?

## Minimal Guiding Principles
- Migrate smallest units first (lists, sections) before full pages.
- Preserve function signatures to avoid wide ripple changes until confidence is high.
- Prefer readable JSX over dense template string concatenation; keep functions small.
- Update tests only as needed; favor semantic assertions over full HTML string snapshots.

## Next Action (Pending Approval)
- Convert `lists.ts` to JSX components and adapt tests. After that proceed to a page template.
